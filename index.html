                    <p>My name is King Ting, I am a student at UCSD and I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I like playing video games and used to compete in tournaments for Super Smash Bros. For Wii U, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and DragonBall Fighterz. In Smash Bros, I main Ryu, Ike, and Captain Falcon. In DragonBall Fighterz, I main Hit, Base Vegeta, and Tien. In my area, people knew me by my gamertag Quickman, but after my team disbanded I have gone by both Nardacyon or Soven. Gaming has been a really big part of my life and another thing that I enjoy just as much is technology and programming.  </p>

                    <p>Since graduating from high school I haven't had a direction in life. All of my friends knew me as one of the smarter kids in my school but felt that my potential was wasted since I didn't put effort in paving my future. Experiencing the real world and experiencing what it's like at college, I realized that I couldn't grow unless I took my life and education seriously. Meeting people in college made me realize that with great determination and honest effort I can become so much more. My education was awful, and being at UCSD has been a challenge to say the least. But I have a passion for computer programming, for mathematics, and for gaming. I have always wanted to be a streamer, a math teacher, and a developer that has a solid grasp in multiple languages. And while I am still young, I will pursue the knowledge I need, to become something great, to make my family and community proud. Knowledge is power and once I gain that power, I will give back to my community so that there can be less struggle and more hope.</p>
